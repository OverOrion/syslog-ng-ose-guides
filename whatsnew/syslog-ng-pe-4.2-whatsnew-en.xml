                <title>Preface</title>
                <para>Welcome to &product; (&abbrev;) version &version; and thank you
                        for choosing our product. This document describes the new features and most
                        important changes since the latest release of &abbrev;. The main aim of
                        this paper is to aid system administrators in planning the migration to the
                        new version of &abbrev;. The following sections describe the news and
                        highlights of &abbrev; &version;.</para>
                <para>This document covers the &version; feature release of the &product; product. </para>
                <para>As of June 2011, the following release policy applies to &product;:</para>
                <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                                <para><emphasis>Long Term Supported or LTS releases</emphasis> (for example, &abbrev; 4 LTS) are supported for 3 years after their original publication date and for 1 year after the next LTS release is published (whichever date is later). The second digit of the revisions of such releases is 0 (for example, &abbrev; 4.0.1). Maintenance releases to LTS releases contain only bugfixes and security updates.</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                                <para><emphasis>Feature releases</emphasis> (for example, &abbrev; 4 F1) are supported for 6 months after their original publication date and for 2 months after succeeding Feature or LTS Release is published (whichever date is later). Feature releases contain enhancements and new features, presumably 1-3 new feature per release. Only the last of the feature releases is supported (for example when a new feature release comes out, the last one becomes unsupported).</para>
                        </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                <warning>
                        <para>Downgrading from a feature release to an earlier (and thus unsupported) feature
                                release, or to the previous LTS release is officially not supported, but usually works as long as your &abbrev; configuration file is appropriate for the old &abbrev; version. However, persistent data like the position of the last processed message in a file source will be probably lost.</para>
                        <para>Logstore files created with a newer version of &abbrev; might not be readable with an older version of &abbrev;.</para>
                </warning>
        </section>
     <section>
         <title>Reliable disk-based buffering</title>
         <para>Reliable disk-based buffering is now available in &abbrev;. This solution prevents message loss in case of a reload/restart, unreachable destination or &abbrev; crash. The feature utilizes the disk-buffer plugin enabling setting parameters such as the maximum size of the disk-buffer file, and the size of the messages used in the memory part of the disk-buffer. The disk-buffer file is created and initialized at startup and gradually grows as new messages arrive.</para>
         <para>For details on reliable disk-based buffering, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin-en" targetptr="configuring_diskbuffer_reliable"/>.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Collecting messages from tables or relational database</title>
        <para>Starting with version <phrase condition="pe">4 F2</phrase>, the &abbrev; application is able to collect messages from tables or relational database, using the <parameter>sql()</parameter> driver. Currently the Microsoft SQL (MSSQL), MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL databases are supported. The &abbrev; application can connect to a database, collect records from a table and then create a message from each record. Every query executed by the SQL source can be customized.</para>
        <para>For details on messages from tables or relational database, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin-en" targetptr="configuring_sources_sql"/>.</para>

    <section>
        <title><trademark>Reliable Log Transfer Protocol</trademark></title>
        <para>The syslog-ng application can send and receive log messages in a reliable way over the TCP transport layer using the <trademark>Reliable Log Transfer Protocol</trademark> (<trademark>RLTP</trademark>). <trademark>RLTP</trademark> is a new transport protocol that prevents message loss during connection breaks. It detects the last received message on the receiving end and then starts resending messages from that point. Therefore, messages are not duplicated at the receiving end in case of a connection break (however, in failover mode this is not completely ensured).  It also allows the negotiation of using TLS with a single source driver (for example negotiation at the beginning of the connection).</para>
        <para>The transport is used between syslog-ng and syslog-ng and it interoperates with the flow control mechanism. It is used on top of TCP, and can use STARTTLS for encryption. <trademark>RLTP</trademark> supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Inside the <trademark>RLTP</trademark> message, the format can be RFC3164 (BSD syslog) or RFC5424 (IETF syslog). The default port of <trademark>RLTP</trademark> is <parameter>35514</parameter>.</para>
        <para><trademark>RLTP</trademark> can be added to the configuration like a transport protocol within the <parameter>syslog()</parameter> driver and the <parameter>network()</parameter> driver.</para>
        <para>For details on <trademark>Reliable Log Transfer Protocol</trademark>, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin-en" targetptr="chapter-rltp"/>.</para>

                    <para><emphasis>New hard macro: Unique receipt ID</emphasis></para>
                    <para>A unique ID for messages generated at reception time on the receiving host. It facilitates defining relationships between messages that are potentially distributed to different files on the same host, or different hosts.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>Installation path in .RUN installer</emphasis></para>
                    <para>The &abbrev; application can be installed to an alternative location. It can be useful if the user intends to install &abbrev; without registering it as a service, or if it cannot be installed to the default location because of policy compliance reasons.</para>
