        <para>The syslog-ng application can send and receive log messages in a reliable way over the TCP transport layer using the Reliable Log Transfer Protocol (RLTP). RLTP is a new transport protocol that prevents message loss during connection breaks. It detects the last received message on the receiving end and then starts resending messages from that point. Therefore, messages are not duplicated at the receiving end in case of a connection break. This protocol allows a message rate of at least 200k message/second. It also allows the negotiation of using TLS with a single source driver (for example negotiation at the beginning of the connection).</para>
        <para>The transport is used between syslog-ng and syslog-ng and it interoperates with the flow control mechanism. It is used on top of TCP, and uses TLS for encryption. RLTP supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Inside the RLTP message, the format can be RFC3164 (BSD syslog) or RFC5424 (IETF syslog).</para>
