Since your log messages can contain all kinds of sensitive information, you should make sure that they are kept safe. The easiest way to protect the log messages as they are transferred from your clients to your logserver is to authenticate and encrypt the connection between the client and the server.</p>

Installing <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> is not covered, <MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="General.ose">but <a href="https://syslog-ng.org/3rd-party-binaries/">downloading it</a> for your platform and installing it should be easy</MadCap:conditionaltext><MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="General.pe">for details, see <a targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="chapter-install" oldrole="olink"></a></MadCap:conditionaltext>.</p>
