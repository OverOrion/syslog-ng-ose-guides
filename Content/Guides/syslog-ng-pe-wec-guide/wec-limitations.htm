<p oldrole="para">The &wec; for &abbrev; currently has the following limitations:</p>
<ul oldrole="itemizedlist">
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">Only source-initiated push subscriptions are supported (Windows hosts connect to the &wecabbrev; server).</p>
<p oldrole="para">An advantage of this, however, is that this requires less firewall rules.</p>
</li>
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">Only HTTPS and SSL certificate based authentication are supported. Kerberos authentication is not supported at the moment.</p>
</li>
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">The compression of events is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">The <MadCap:xref href="simplesect-subscriptions.htm#table-batchsizelimit"></MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="simplesect-subscriptions.htm#table-batchtimeoutlimit"></MadCap:xref> options are not enforced on the Windows host side: Windows is handling these values only as a recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">On Windows 7 and Windows 2008 platforms, there is a known issue. After several reconnects (if &wecabbrev; is restarted quickly), the remote sender can stop forwarding the logs for a certain period of time. In this case, restarting the Windows RM service can help.</p>
<p oldrole="para">This issue can also occur between two Windows machines. It has been reported to Microsoft and is awaiting resolution.</p>
