<h1 name="wec-message-format">Message format in &wec; for &abbrev;</h1>
<p oldrole="para">The &wec; for &abbrev; is supported for Windows 7 or newer platforms. Starting with Windows 7, event logging is XML-based, meaning that event log messages reach &wecabbrev; in XML format. When these are forwarded to the &abbrev; server, &abbrev; parses them into key-value pairs using the XML parser.</p>
<p oldrole="para">Once event log data is available in &abbrev;, you have the flexibility to modify and format data any way you want, using macros and rewrite rules.</p>
<p oldrole="para">Note that while event log data as processed by the &wecabbrev; tool may differ from the data collected and made available by the &agent;, the &wec; tool provides you with greater freedom and flexibility when it comes to manipulating your raw data.</p>
