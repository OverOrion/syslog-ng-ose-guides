<p oldrole="para">The &wec; tool applies flow control to minimize event log loss.</p>
<p oldrole="para">&wecabbrev; regularly (in every second) polls the datagram socket that will receive the Windows events to check whether it exists already. Once the socket has been created (&abbrev; has started up), &wecabbrev; connects to the socket and accepts the incoming connections from the Windows hosts. If the datagram socket does not exist, &wecabbrev; refuses the incoming connections.</p>
<p oldrole="para">If the socket exists (&abbrev; is running) but &abbrev; does not read the Unix datagram socket, &wecabbrev; fills up the kernel buffer of the datagram socket and stores <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">queuesize</span> amounts of log messages in the memory. When all buffers are full, &wecabbrev; stops reading messages from the HTTP connections to prevent message loss.</p>
<p oldrole="para">The buffer size of a datagram socket is determined by certain Linux kernel parameters: the value of <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">rmem_*</span> (max/default) and the count of <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">net.unix.max_dgram_qlen</span>.</p>

<p oldrole="para">&wecabbrev; flags a message as delivered once it has put the message in the socket buffer. If &abbrev; does not read the socket for some reason (for example, because it is still flow-controlled) and &abbrev; is stopped, the contents of this socket (that is, the messages that are in the kernel buffer, unread by &abbrev;) will be lost.</p>
<p oldrole="para">This is why in cases when a restart is necessary, it is recommended to stop the &wec; and &abbrev; in the following order:</p>
<ol oldrole="orderedlist">
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">&wec;</p>
</li>
<li oldrole="listitem">
<p oldrole="para">&abbrev;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p oldrole="para">While it is not guaranteed that &abbrev; has read all sockets by the time you stop it, at least you can maximize the chances that it has.</p>
