<p oldrole="para">Once you are ready with generating CA, server and client certificates, copy them to the respective machines and configure &abbrev; to use them. In theory, the CA and other certificates could be placed anywhere in the file system. In practice, server applications, such as &abbrev; are often protected by AppArmor, SELinux or other mechanisms, therefore it is recommended to create sub-directories where the <span class="Code" oldrole="filename">syslog-ng.conf</span> resides. This way &abbrev; can read them without modifying the related access rules.</p>
