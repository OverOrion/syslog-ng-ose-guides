        <p oldrole="para">Collecting log messages is an essential part of managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting IT systems. Since your log messages can contain all kinds of sensitive information, you should make sure that they are kept safe. The easiest way to protect the log messages as they are transferred from your clients to your logserver is to authenticate and encrypt the connection between the client and the server.</p>
        <p oldrole="para">This tutorial shows you step-by-step how to create the certificates required to authenticate your server and your clients, and how to configure <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> (<MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>) to send your log messages in an encrypted connection. Installing <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> is not covered, <MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="General.ose">but <a href="https://syslog-ng.org/3rd-party-binaries/">downloading it</a> for your platform and installing it should be easy</MadCap:conditionaltext><MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="General.pe">for details, see <a targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="chapter-install" oldrole="olink"></a></MadCap:conditionaltext>.</p>
        <p oldrole="para">The tutorial is organized as follows:</p>

                    </MadCap:xref> describes how to create the required certificates to encrypt and authenticate the connection between your logserver and your clients. Actually, you can use this part of the tutorial even if you do not use <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, as it is independent from the logging application you use.</p>
