<p oldrole="para">Collecting log messages is an essential part of managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting IT systems. Since your log messages can contain all kinds of sensitive information, you should make sure that they are kept safe. The easiest way to protect the log messages as they are transferred from your clients to your logserver is to authenticate and encrypt the connection between the client and the server.</p>
<p oldrole="para">This tutorial shows you step-by-step how to create the certificates required to authenticate your server and your clients, and how to configure &product; (&abbrev;) to send your log messages in an encrypted connection. Installing &abbrev; is not covered, <MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="ose">but <a href="https://syslog-ng.org/3rd-party-binaries/">downloading it</a> for your platform and installing it should be easy</MadCap:conditionaltext><MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="pe">for details, see <a href="https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/one-identity-psm/syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin/chapter-install" oldrole="olink"></a></MadCap:conditionaltext>.</p>
