        <h1 name="executive-summary">Executive summary</h1>
        <p>The main findings of the performance tests are as follows:</p>
        <ul oldrole="itemizedlist">
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>The fastest way the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application can receive log messages from the network is using plain TCP transport with the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">network()</span> source driver.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>By default, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> runs in multithreaded mode to scale to multiple CPUs or cores for increased performance.</p>
                <p>Depending on the exact <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> configuration, environment, and other parameters, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> is capable of processing:</p>
                <ul oldrole="itemizedlist">
                    <li oldrole="listitem">
                        <p>over 635,000 messages per second (over 235 MB of data per second) when receiving messages from multiple connections and storing them in text files,</p>
                    </li>
                    <li oldrole="listitem">
                        <p>over 615,000 messages per second (over 230 MB of data per second) when receiving messages from multiple secure (TLS-encrypted) connections and storing them in text files.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>The tests were performed using real log messages of 135-2100 bytes and of varying complexity, obtained from real machines. The tests ran for 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>PatternDB only works on one thread. Therefore, using PatternDB can significantly decrease performance depending on how many messages match a pattern in the specified ruleset. If a large amount of messages are being received but the specified pattern matches a small number of messages, there is no significant performance degradation.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>Using disk buffer on the client side can significantly degrade performance. This is especially the case if relays that are heavily loaded are used together with disk buffer enabled on the relays. Performance can also be degraded if lots of messages are received on the syslog-ng server, and are forwarded through the network (for example, to a log analyzer or SIEM), and therefore disk buffer is enabled on the server as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>Higher <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">stats_level</span> decreases the performance. For example, <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">stats_level(2)</span> means -10% in performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>Simple filtering (for example, filtering on facility or tag) has no significant impact on performance. However, regular expressions, even simple ones, slightly decrease the message-processing rate, by about 15%.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p>Results of the performance tests show a standard deviation of +-5%. This means that when comparing measurements of a particular dimension (for example, non-encrypted versus encrypted log processing), a difference of 5% does not necessarily indicate a real difference in performance.</p>
