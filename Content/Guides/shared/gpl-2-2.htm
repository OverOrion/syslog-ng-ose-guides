        <h1 name="gpl-2-2">Section 2</h1>
        <p oldrole="para">You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of <MadCap:xref href="gpl-2-1.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 1</span></MadCap:xref> above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
        <ol numeration="loweralpha" oldrole="orderedlist" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p oldrole="para">You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p oldrole="para">You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
            </li>
            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p oldrole="para">If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: If the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p oldrole="para">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
        <p oldrole="para">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
        <p oldrole="para">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
