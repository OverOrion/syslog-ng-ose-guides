        <h1>Section 2</h1>
        <p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
			of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
			distribute such modifications or work under the terms of<MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-1.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 1</span></MadCap:xref>
			above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
		</p>
        <ol numeration="loweralpha" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
					stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
					charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a name="lgpl-2-2-d"></a>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
						table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
						the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
						is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
						in the event an application does not supply such function or
						table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
					its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
                <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
						a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
						application. Therefore, <a href="#lgpl-2-2-d">Subsection 2d</a> requires that any
						application-supplied function or table used by this function must
						be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
					root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
			identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
			and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
			themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
			sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
			distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
			on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
			this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
			entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
		it.</p>
        <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
			your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
			exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
		collective works based on the Library.</p>
        <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
			with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
			a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
		the scope of this License.</p>
