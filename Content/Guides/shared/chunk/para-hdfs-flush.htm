Hadoop performs this action automatically, depending on its configured block size, and the amount of data received. There is no way for the &abbrev; application to influence when the messages are actually written to disk. This means that &abbrev; cannot guarantee that a message sent to HDFS is actually written to disk. When using flow-control<MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="pe6"> or <trademark>RLTP</trademark></MadCap:conditionaltext>, &abbrev; acknowledges a message as written to disk when it passes the message to the HDFS client. This method is as reliable as your HDFS environment.</body></html>
