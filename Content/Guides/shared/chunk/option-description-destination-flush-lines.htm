        <p><i style="font-style: normal;">Description:</i> Specifies how many lines are flushed to a destination at a time. The <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application waits for this number of lines to accumulate and sends them off in a single batch. Increasing this number increases throughput as more messages are sent in a single batch, but also increases message latency.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application flushes the messages if it has sent <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">flush-lines()</span> number of messages, or the queue became empty. If you stop or reload <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> or in case of network sources, the connection with the client is closed, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> automatically sends the unsent messages to the destination.</p>
