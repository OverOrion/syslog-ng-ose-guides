        <p>If you are using load-balancing (that is, you have configured multiple servers in the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">url()</span> option), increase the number of worker threads at least to the number of servers. For example, if you have set three URLs, set the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">workers()</span> option to 3 or more.</p>
