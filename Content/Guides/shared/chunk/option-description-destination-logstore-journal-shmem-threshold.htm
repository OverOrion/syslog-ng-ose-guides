Opening new logstore files means allocating memory for one new journal block for every new file. In extreme situations involving large traffic, this can lead to &abbrev; consuming the entire memory of the system. Adjust the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">journal-block-size()</span> and your file-naming conventions as needed to avoid such situations.
