        <p name="para-rltp-intro" oldrole="para">The <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> application can send and receive log messages in a reliable way over the TCP transport layer using the <MadCap:variable name="syslogngPEVariables.RLTP" /> (<MadCap:variable name="syslogngPEVariables.RLTPUppercase" />). <MadCap:variable name="syslogngPEVariables.RLTPUppercase" /> is a proprietary transport protocol that prevents message loss during connection breaks. The transport is used between <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> hosts (for example, a client and a server, or a client-relay-server), and interoperates with the flow-control and reliable disk-buffer mechanisms of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" />, thus providing the best way to prevent message loss.</p>
        <p>The sender detects which messages the receiver has successfully received. If messages are lost during the transfer, the sender resends the missing messages, starting from the last successfully received message. Therefore, messages are not duplicated at the receiving end in case of a connection break (however, in failover mode, this is not completely ensured). <MadCap:variable name="syslogngPEVariables.RLTPUppercase" /> also allows for encrypted and non-encrypted connections to be received on the same port, using a single source driver.</p>
