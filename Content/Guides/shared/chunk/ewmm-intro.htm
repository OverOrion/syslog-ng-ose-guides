        <p>The <a href="syslog-ng-message-format.htm">Enterprise-wide message model or EWMM</a> allows you to deliver structured messages from the initial receiving syslog-ng component right up to the central log server, through any number of hops. It does not matter if you parse the messages on the client, on a relay, or on the central server, their structured results will be available where you store the messages. Optionally, you can also forward the original raw message as the first syslog-ng component in your infrastructure has received it, which is important if you want to forward a message for example to a SIEM system. To make use of the enterprise-wide message model, you have to use the <a href="../../syslog-ng-guide-admin/chapters/destination-syslog-ng.htm">syslog-ng() destination on the sender side</a>, and the <a href="../../syslog-ng-guide-admin/chapters/source-default-network-drivers.htm">default-network-drivers() source on the receiver side</a>.</p>
