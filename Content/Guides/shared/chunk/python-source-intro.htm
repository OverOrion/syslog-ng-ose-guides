        <p oldrole="para">The Python source allows you to write your own source in Python. You can import external Python modules to receive or fetch the messages. Since many services have a Python library, the Python source makes integrating <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> very easy and quick.</p>
        <p>You can write two different type of sources in Python:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Server-style sources that receives messages. Write server-style sources if you want to use an event-loop based, nonblocking server framework in Python, or if you want to implement a custom loop.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fetcher-style sources that actively fetch messages. In general, write fetcher-style sources (for example, when using simple blocking APIs), unless you explicitly need a server-style source.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
