<html xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd"><body oldrole="p">When using wildcards, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> monitors every matching file (up to the limit set in the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">max-files()</span> option), and can receive new log messages from any of the files. However, monitoring (polling) many files (that is, more than ten) has a significant overhead and may affect performance. On Linux this overhead is not so significant, because <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> uses the inotify feature of the kernel. Set the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">max-files()</span> option at least to the number of files you want to monitor. If the wildcard-file source matches more files than the value of the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">max-files()</span> option, it is random which files will <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> actually monitor. The default value of <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">max-files()</span> is 100.</body></html>
