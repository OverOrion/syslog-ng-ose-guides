			<p>Stores the matches of the regular expression into the <span class="Code">$0, ... $255</span> variables. The <span class="Code">$0</span> stores the entire match, <span class="Code">$1</span> is the first group of the match (parentheses), and so on. Named matches (also called named subpatterns), for example, <span class="Code">(?&lt;name&gt;...)</span>, are stored as well. Matches from the last filter expression can be referenced in regular expressions.</p>
