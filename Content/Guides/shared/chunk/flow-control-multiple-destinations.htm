        <p>Using flow-control on a source has an important side-effect if the messages of the source are sent to multiple destinations. If flow-control is in use and one of the destinations cannot accept the messages, the other destinations do not receive any messages either, because syslog-ng stops reading the source. For example, if messages from a source are sent to a remote server and also stored locally in a file, and the network connection to the server becomes unavailable, neither the remote server nor the local file will receive any messages.</p>
		<div class="Note">
			<p class="Hyphenation"><span class="AllNoteStyles">NOTE:</span> Creating separate log paths for the destinations that use the same flow-controlled source does not avoid the problem.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you use flow-control and reliable disk-based buffering together with multiple destinations, the flow-control starts slowing down the source only when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>one destination is down, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the number of messages stored in the disk buffer of the destination reaches (<span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">disk-buf-size()</span> minus <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">mem-buf-size()</span>).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
