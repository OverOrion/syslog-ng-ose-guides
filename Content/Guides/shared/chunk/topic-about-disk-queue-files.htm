            <h6>Normal and reliable queue files</h6>
            <p>The key difference between disk queue files that employ the <span class="Code">reliable(yes)</span> option and not is the strategy they employ. Reliable disk queues guarantee that all the messages passing through them are written to disk first, and removed from the queue only after the destination has confirmed that the message has been successfully received. This prevents message loss, for example, due to <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> crashes if the client and the destination server communicate using the <MadCap:variable name="General.ALTP" /> (<MadCap:variable name="General.ALTPuppercase" />). Note that the <MadCap:variable name="General.ALTP" /> is available only in <MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="General.OSE"><a href="https://syslog-ng.com/log-management-software"><MadCap:variable name="General.PELong" /> version 6 LTS</a></MadCap:conditionaltext><MadCap:conditionaltext MadCap:conditions="General.PE"><a href="hhttps://syslog-ng.com/log-management-software"><MadCap:variable name="General.PELong" /> version 6 LTS</a></MadCap:conditionaltext>. Of course, using the <span class="Code">reliable(yes)</span> option introduces a significant performance penalty as well. </p>
            <p>Both reliable and normal disk-buffers employ an in-memory output queue (set in <span class="Code">quot-size()</span>) and an in-memory overflow queue (set in <span class="Code">mem-buf-size()</span> for reliable disk-buffers, or <span class="Code">mem-buf-length()</span> for normal disk-buffers). The difference between reliable and normal disk-buffers is that when the reliable disk-buffer uses one of its in-memory queues, it also stores the message on the disk, whereas the normal disk-buffer stores the message only in memory. The normal disk-buffer only uses the disk if the in-memory output buffer is filled up completely. This approach has better performance (due to fewer disk I/O operations), but also carries the risk of losing a maximum of <span class="Code">quot-size()</span> plus <span class="Code">mem-buf-length()</span> number of messages in case of an unexpected power failure or application crash.</p>

        <div>
            <h6>Size of the queue files</h6>
            <p>Disk queue files tend to grow. Each may take up to <span class="Code">disk-buf-size()</span> bytes on the disk. Due to the nature of reliable queue files, all the messages traversing the queue are written to disk, constantly increasing the size of the queue file.</p>
            <p>The disk-buffer file's size should be considered as the configured <span class="Code">disk-buf-size()</span> at any point of time, even if it does not have messages in it. Truncating the disk-buffer file can slow down disk I/O operations, so <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> does not always truncate the file when it would be possible (see the <span class="Code"><MadCap:xref href="option-destination-diskbuffer.htm#diskbuf-trunkate-size-ratio"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">truncate-size-ratio()</span></MadCap:xref></span> option). If a large disk-buffer file is not desirable, you should set the <span class="Code">disk-buf-size()</span> option  to a smaller value.</p>
