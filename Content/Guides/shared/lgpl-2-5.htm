        <h1>Section 5</h1>
        <p>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
			Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
			linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
			work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
		therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
        <p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
			creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
			contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
			library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
		<MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-6.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 6</span></MadCap:xref> states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
        <p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
			that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
			derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
			Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
			linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
		threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
        <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
			structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
			functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
			file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
			work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
		Library will still fall under <MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-6.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 6</span></MadCap:xref>.)</p>
        <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
			distribute the object code for the work under the terms of <MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-6.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 6</span></MadCap:xref>.
			Any executables containing that work also fall under <MadCap:xref href="lgpl-2-6.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Section 6</span></MadCap:xref>,
		whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
