        <p oldrole="para">The syslog-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging application that is ideal for creating centralized and trusted logging solutions.</p>
        <p>Typically, syslog-ng is used to manage log messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect the log messages of several devices on a single, central log server. The different devices — called syslog-ng clients — all run syslog-ng, and collect the log messages from the various applications, files, and other sources. The clients send all important log messages to the remote syslog-ng server, which sorts and stores them.</p>
