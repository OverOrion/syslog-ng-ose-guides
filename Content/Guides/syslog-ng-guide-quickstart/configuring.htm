        <p>The syslog-ng application reads incoming messages and forwards them to the selected <i oldrole="emphasis">destinations</i>. The syslog-ng application can receive messages from files, remote hosts, and other <i oldrole="emphasis">sources</i>.</p>
        <p>Log messages enter syslog-ng in one of the defined sources, and are sent to one or more <i oldrole="emphasis">destinations</i>.</p>
        <p>Sources and destinations are independent objects: <i oldrole="emphasis">log paths</i> define what syslog-ng does with a message, connecting the sources to the destinations. A log path consists of one or more sources and one or more destinations, messages arriving from a source are sent to every destination listed in the log path. A log path defined in syslog-ng is called a <i oldrole="emphasis">log statement</i>.</p>
        <p>There are many other optional elements, like filters, parsers, etc., but in this guide we focus on a core syslog-ng feature: reliable logging.</p>

        <p>To make <MadCap:variable name="syslogngPEVariables.RLTPUppercase" /> work, you have to enable it on the server and on all participating clients as well. In the following example, a minimum working configuration is provided.
