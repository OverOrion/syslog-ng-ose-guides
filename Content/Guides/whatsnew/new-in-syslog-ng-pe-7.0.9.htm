        <h1 name="new-in-syslog-ng-pe-7.0.9">Highlights of 7.0.9</h1>
        <h6>Receive logs using the Advanced Log Transport Protocol (ALTP)</h6>
        <p>With the new Advanced Log Transport Protocol (ALTP) you can receive log messages in a reliable way over the TCP transport layer. ALTP is a proprietary transport protocol that prevents message loss during connection breaks. The transport is used between <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> hosts (for example, a client and a server, or a client-relay-server), and interoperates with the flow-control and reliable disk-buffer mechanisms of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, thus providing the best way to prevent message loss.</p>
        <p>ALTP is the successor of the Reliable Log Transport Protocol (RLTP) introduced in version 6 LTS. Starting with version 7.0.9, the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application can receive messages sent using RLTP from hosts that are running version 6 of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> or the <MadCap:variable name="General.agent"></MadCap:variable> application. For details, see <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="chapter-rltp"></a>.</p>
        <h6>Easily receive and parse messages from remote hosts</h6>
        <p>The <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">default-network-drivers()</span> source is a special source that uses multiple source drivers to receive and parse several different types of syslog messages from the network. For details, see <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="source-default-network-drivers"></a>.</p>
        <h6>Transfer log messages and their key-value pairs between syslog-ng nodes</h6>
        <p>The <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="syslog-ng-message-format">Enterprise-wide message model or EWMM</a> allows you to deliver structured messages from the initial receiving syslog-ng component right up to the central log server, through any number of hops. It does not matter if you parse the messages on the client, on a relay, or on the central server, their structured results will be available where you store the messages. Optionally, you can also forward the original raw message as the first syslog-ng component in your infrastructure has received it, which is important if you want to forward a message for example to a SIEM system. To make use of the enterprise-wide message model, you have to use the <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="destination-syslog-ng">syslog-ng() destination on the sender side</a>, and the <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="source-default-network-drivers">default-network-drivers() source on the receiver side</a>.</p>
        <h6>Clearer configuration using if, else, elif conditions</h6>
        <p>You can use <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">if {}</span>, <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">elif {}</span>, and <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">else {}</span> blocks to configure conditional expressions. For details, see <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="concepts-if-else-conditional-expressions"></a>.</p>
        <h6>Message parsing</h6>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> version 7.0.9 includes parsers for the <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="parser-sudo">sudo</a> and <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="parser-iptables">iptables</a> applications.</p>
        <h6>Compliance and integration</h6>
        <p>You can now store and forward the incoming messages exactly as received using the <span class="Code">store-raw-message</span> source flag and the <span class="Code">RAWMSG</span> macro. These are especially useful if you are forwarding the messages to a SIEM, or if you have to preserve the original message for legal reasons. For details, see <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="reference-macros"></a>.</p>
        <h6>Enhancements</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="Code">ignore-tns-ora()</span> option has been added to the document. For details, see <a role="olink" targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="configuring-sql-oracle"></a>.</p>
