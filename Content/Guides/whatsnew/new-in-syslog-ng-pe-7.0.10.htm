        <h1 name="new-in-syslog-ng-pe-7.0.9">New features in <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> 7.0.10</h1>
        <h6>Send logs using the Advanced Log Transport Protocol (ALTP)</h6>
        <p>Using the new Advanced Log Transport Protocol (ALTP), you can send (and receive) log messages in a reliable way over the TCP transport layer. ALTP is a proprietary transport protocol that prevents message loss during connection breaks. The transport is used between <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> hosts (for example, a client and a server, or a client-relay-server), and interoperates with the flow-control and reliable disk-buffer mechanisms of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, thus providing the best way to prevent message loss.</p>
        <p>ALTP is the successor of the Reliable Log Transport Protocol (RLTP) introduced in version 6 LTS. Starting with version 7.0.9, the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> application can receive messages sent using RLTP from hosts that are running version 6 of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> or the <MadCap:variable name="General.agent" /> application. Starting with version 7.0.10, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> can now also send messages using ALTP to hosts that are running version 6 or at least version 7.0.9 of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /> or the <MadCap:variable name="General.agent" /> application.

                <p>The <span class="Code">failover()</span> option has been added to the document. Additionally, the <span class="Code">failover-servers()</span> option has been deprecated and removed from the document. The <span class="Code">failover()</span> option allows you to specify what happens after <MadCap:variable name="whatsnewPEVariables.ProductNameShort" /> fails over to a secondary server.
