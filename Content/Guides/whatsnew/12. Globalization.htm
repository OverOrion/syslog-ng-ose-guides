        <h1>Globalization</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="CommonConditions_DoNotEdit.DoNotPublish" style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical writers should use the text automatically generated from the Avenue Product Release Calendar.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="CommonConditions_DoNotEdit.DoNotPublish" style="text-decoration: underline;">The Product Release Calendar uses an icon to indicate whether globalization information is available. If the circle on the icon is green, the globalization information has been entered and approved and can be used in a statement.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="CommonConditions_DoNotEdit.DoNotPublish" style="text-decoration: underline;">If your product does not have a green Internationalization icon, you will need to talk to the development manager so that they can update the information and get it approved.</p>
