        <p name="para-philosophy-intro">Typically, syslog-ng is used to manage log messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect the log messages of several devices on a single, central log server. The different devices &#8212; called syslog-ng clients &#8212; all run syslog-ng, and collect the log messages from the various applications, files, and other <i>sources</i>. The clients send all important log messages to the remote syslog-ng server, which sorts and stores them.</p>
