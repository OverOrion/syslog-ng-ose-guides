        <li><i>Message loss outside of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /></i>: One of the advantages of this configuration over when the disk-buffer option is not used at all is that when the <span class="Code">log-iw-size()</span> control window is full, the flow-control mechanism stops reading logs from the sources much later. This is because when it is not possible to send logs directly to the destinations, they are written to the disk. It is only after the disk-buffer file has been filled to its full capacity that the sources are stopped. This enables you to minimize the loss of log messages during peak hours or when the network is temporarily down.</li>
