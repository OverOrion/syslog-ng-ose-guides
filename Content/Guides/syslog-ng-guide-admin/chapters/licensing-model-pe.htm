        <h1 name="licensing-model-pe">Licensing model and modes of operation</h1>
        <p>A Log Source Host (LSH) is any host, server, or device (including virtual machines, active or passive networking devices, syslog-ng clients and relays, and so on) that is capable of sending log messages. Log Source Hosts are identified by their IP addresses, so virtual machines and vhosts are separately counted.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> application has three distinct modes of operation: Client, Relay, and Server.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In Client mode <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> collects local logs generated by the host it is running on, and forwards them through a network connection to the central <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> server, a relay, or another network destination. If you install the <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> application in Client mode on a host, it counts as a Log Source Host, even if it does not send log messages to a <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In Relay mode <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> receives logs through the network from Log Source Hosts and forwards them to the central <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> server, a relay, or another network destination. If you install the <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> application in Relay mode on a host, it counts as a Log Source Host, even if it does not send log messages to a <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> server.</p>
                <p>Relays cannot store the received log messages in local files, except for the log messages of the relay host. Naturally, relays can use the disk-buffer option for every message.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In Server mode <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> acts as a central log-collecting server that receives messages through a network connection, and stores them locally, or forwards them to other destinations or external systems (for example, a SIEM or a database). Installing the <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> application in Server mode requires a license file, this license file determines the number of Log Source Hosts that can send log messages to the <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> server.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div><h6>Notes about counting the licensed hosts</h6>
        <p>Note that the number of source hosts is important, not the number of hosts that directly sends messages to <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable>: every host that send messages to the server (directly or using a relay) counts as a Log Source Host.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the actual IP address of the host differs from the IP address received by looking up its IP address from its hostname in the DNS, the syslog-ng server counts them as two different hosts.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>If the <span class="Code">no-parse</span> flag is set in a message source on the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> server, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> assumes that the message arrived from the host (that is, from the last hop) that sent the message to <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, and information about the original sender is lost.</p>
