                <p oldrole="para">A number of worker threads that process the messages. You can influence the behavior of worker threads using the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">threaded()</span> option and the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">--worker-threads</span> command-line option.</p>
            </li>

        <p oldrole="para">The maximum number of worker threads <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> uses is the number of CPUs or cores in the host running <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> (up to 64). You can limit this value using the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">--worker-threads</span> command-line option that sets the maximum total number of threads <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> can use, including the main <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> thread. However, the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">--worker-threads</span> option does not affect the supervisor of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>. The supervisor is a separate process (see <MadCap:xref href="../../../manpages/syslog-ng.8.html"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">The syslog-ng manual page</span></MadCap:xref>), but certain operating systems might display it as a thread. In addition, certain destinations always run in a separate thread, independently of the multithreading (<span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">threaded()</span>) and <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">--worker-threads</span> settings of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
        <p oldrole="para">When an event requiring a new thread occurs (for example, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> receives new messages, or a destination becomes available), <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> tries to start a new thread. If there are no free threads, the task waits until a thread finishes its task and becomes available. There are two types of worker threads:</p>

The thread then processes these messages, that is, performs filtering, rewriting and other tasks as necessary, and puts the log message into the queue of the destination. If the destination does not have a queue (for example, usertty), the reader thread sends the message to the destination, without the interaction of a separate writer thread.</p>

            <li oldrole="listitem">
                <p oldrole="para">Writer threads take the messages from the queue of the destination and send them to the destination, that is, write the messages into a file, or send them to the syslog server over the network. The writer thread starts to process messages from the queue only if the destination is writable, and there are enough messages in the queue, as set in the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">flush-lines()</span> and the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">flush-timeout()</span> options. Writer threads stop processing messages when the destination becomes unavailable, or there are no more messages in the queue.</p>
