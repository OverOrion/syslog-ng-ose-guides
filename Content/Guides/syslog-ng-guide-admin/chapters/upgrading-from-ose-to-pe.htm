        <h1 name="upgrading-from-ose-to-pe">Upgrade from syslog-ng OSE to <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev" /></h1>
        <p>If you wish to upgrade your existing syslog-ng OSE installation to <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, there are a number of considerations to keep in mind. This section highlights the main differences between syslog-ng OSE and <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> that are useful to know before performing an upgrade. It also provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to do the upgrade.</p>
        <h6 oldrole="formalpara">Feature differences:</h6>
        <p>syslog-ng OSE includes certain features that are highly experimental, require special external dependencies, or are important only to a very limited set of users. While <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> is built from the same code base, it includes only a subset of syslog-ng OSE features. Those that are well tested and represent commercial value. These features are commercially supported as they are covered by automated end-to-end tests, which make sure that they not only compile but work correctly on many different platforms.</p>
        <p>This means that your syslog-ng OSE installation may contain features that are not part of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, or if they are, they may not have been tested.</p>
        <h6 oldrole="formalpara">Packaging:</h6>
        <p>The packaging of syslog-ng OSE and <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> also differ greatly.</p>
        <p>With syslog-ng OSE, distribution packages do not bundle dependencies and only include features for which dependencies are available within the distribution. Packaging is modular to make sure that you install only a minimal set of extra dependencies. In addition, the naming and content of subpackages varies between distributions, and there are also unofficial syslog-ng OSE packages enabling more features than available in official distribution packages.</p>
        <p>In the case of <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>, all dependencies are included in a single package either in a distribution specific format (rpm or deb) or in a generic <span class="Code" oldrole="filename">.run</span> installer.</p>
