        <p>Buying a <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> (<MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>) license permits you to perform the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Install one instance of the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application in server mode to a single host. This host acts as the central log server of the network. You have to install the license file only on this host.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Install the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> application in relay or client mode on host computers within your organization (on any supported platform). You cannot redistribute the application to third parties. The total number of hosts permitted to run <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> in relay or client mode is limited by the <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> license. The client and relay hosts may use any operating system supported by <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>. For details, see <a href="https://www.syslog-ng.com/">syslog-ng.com</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> license determines the number of individual hosts (also called log source hosts) that can send log messages to <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
        <p>License grants and legal restrictions are fully described in the <MadCap:variable name="General.eula"></MadCap:variable>. Note that the <MadCap:variable name="General.eula"></MadCap:variable> and the <MadCap:variable name="General.productusageterms"></MadCap:variable> apply only to scenarios where the Licensee (the organization who has purchased the product) is the end user of the product. In any other scenario — for example, if you want to offer services provided by <MadCap:variable name="General.product"></MadCap:variable> to your customers in an OEM or a Managed Service Provider (MSP) scenario — you have to negotiate the exact terms and conditions with <MadCap:variable name="General.vendor"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
