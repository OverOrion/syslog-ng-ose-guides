            <i>TCP error</i>: With a TCP connection, when messages are sent from the destination drivers to the destination servers, messages are written to the TCP socket. The TCP socket sends an acknowledgment to the destination drivers once it has successfully processed messages. A message is considered "delivered" when no error occurs during the process of writing the data to the socket, and the acknowledgment is received. Note, however, that if something goes wrong after messages have been successfully written to the TCP socket, log messages can still get lost. Also note that TCP errors can occur on both the source and the destination side, and both can cause the loss of log messages.
