<p oldrole="para">To enable reliable disk-based buffering, use the <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">disk-buffer(reliable(yes))</span> parameter in the destination. Use reliable disk-based buffering if you do not want to lose logs in case of reload/restart, unreachable destination or &abbrev; crash. This solution provides a slower, but reliable disk-buffer option. It is created and initialized at startup and gradually grows as new messages arrive. The filename of the reliable disk buffer file is the following: <span class="Code" oldrole="filename">&lt;syslog-ng path&gt;/var/syslog-ng-00000.rqf</span>.</p>
