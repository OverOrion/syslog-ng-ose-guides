        <p oldrole="para">The <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">pseudofile()</span> destination driver is a very simple driver, aimed at delivering messages to special files such as files in the <span class="Code" oldrole="filename">/proc</span>, <span class="Code" oldrole="filename">/dev</span> or <span class="Code" oldrole="filename">/sys</span> directories. It opens and closes the file after each write operation, instead of keeping it open. It does not append further data. It does not support templates in the filename, and does not have a queue, processing is performed immediately as read by the source. Therefore, no loss is possible, but it takes CPU time from the source, so it is not adequate in high traffic situations.</p>
