        <MadCap:keyword term="name resolution">
        </MadCap:keyword>
        <p>The syslog-ng application can resolve the hostnames of the clients and include them in the log messages. However, the performance of syslog-ng is severely degraded if the domain name server is unaccessible or slow. Therefore, it is not recommended to resolve hostnames in syslog-ng. If you must use name resolution from syslog-ng, consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use DNS caching. Verify that the DNS cache is large enough to store all important hostnames. (By default, the syslog-ng DNS cache stores <span class="Code">1007</span> entries.)</p><pre>options { dns-cache-size(2000); };</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the IP addresses of the clients change only rarely, set the expiry of the DNS cache large.</p><pre>options { dns-cache-expire(87600); };</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If possible, resolve the hostnames locally. For details, see <MadCap:xref href="example-local-dns.htm"><span style="color: #04aada;" class="mcFormatColor">Resolving hostnames locally</span></MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
