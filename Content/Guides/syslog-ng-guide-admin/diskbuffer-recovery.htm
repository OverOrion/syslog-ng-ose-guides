        <p>When you change the configuration of a <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> host that uses disk-based buffering (also called disk queue), <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> may start new disk buffer files for the destinations that you have changed. In this case, <MadCap:variable name="General.abbrev"></MadCap:variable> abandons the old disk queue files. If there were unsent log messages in the disk queue files, these messages remain in the disk queue files, and will not be sent to the destinations.</p>
