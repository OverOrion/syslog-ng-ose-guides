This is useful for files which always indicate readability, even though no new lines were appended. If this value is higher than zero, syslog-ng will not attempt to use <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">poll()</span> on the file, but checks whether the file changed every time the <span class="Code" oldrole="parameter">follow-freq()</span> interval (in seconds) has elapsed. Floating-point numbers (for example <span class="Code" oldrole="userinput">1.5</span>) can be used as well.</p>
