<p oldrole="para">The syslog-ng application reads incoming messages and forwards them to the selected <i oldrole="emphasis">destinations</i>. The syslog-ng application can receive messages from files, remote hosts, and other <i oldrole="emphasis">sources</i>.</p>

<p oldrole="para">Sources and destinations are independent objects, <i oldrole="emphasis">log paths</i> define what syslog-ng does with a message, connecting the sources to the destinations. A log path consists of one or more sources and one or more destinations: messages arriving from a source are sent to every destination listed in the log path. A log path defined in syslog-ng is called a <i oldrole="emphasis">log statement</i>.</p>
<MadCap:keyword term="filters"></MadCap:keyword>
<p oldrole="para">Optionally, log paths can include <i oldrole="emphasis">filters</i>. Filters are rules that select only certain messages, for example, selecting only messages sent by a specific application. If a log path includes filters, syslog-ng sends only the messages satisfying the filter rules to the destinations set in the log path.</p>

<MadCap:keyword term="rewrite rules"></MadCap:keyword>
<p oldrole="para">Other optional elements that can appear in log statements are <i oldrole="emphasis">parsers</i> and <i oldrole="emphasis">rewriting rules</i>. Parsers segment messages into different fields to help processing the messages, while rewrite rules modify the messages by adding, replacing, or removing parts of the messages.</p>
