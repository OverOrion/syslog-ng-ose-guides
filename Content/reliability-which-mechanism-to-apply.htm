        <p>Choosing the ideal configuration for your environment may not always be a straightforward decision. Depending on your use case, it is worth considering which outcome is more desirable (with the following points representing the two opposite ends of the spectrum):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an application that does not slow down or stop - at the price of losing logs</li>
            <li>no log messages get lost - at the price of a slower application or an application that stops (temporarily)</li>
        </ul>

This way, you will not be using the whole application-client-server chain at full capacity, and yet still be able to spot the loss of application log messages at the beginning of the chain already, in the internal logs of the client. </p>
