        <para/>
    </formalpara>
    <para>On servers where logs of many clients are retained for extended periods of time, log files are usually stored under a directory hierarchy. To help sort incoming log messages to such hierarchies, syslog-ng supports the use of macros. Depending on the needs of your organization, date, source host, or combined solutions can be used.</para>
    <para>In the following example, the file destination on the server is modified to also write messages into a directory structure under <filename>/var/log</filename>, where the first level is the year, the second level is the week of the year, followed by a file name based on the sending host.</para>
