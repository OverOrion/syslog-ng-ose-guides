    <step>
        <para>If you want to use the Java-based modules of &abbrev; (for example, the Elasticsearch, HDFS, or Kafka destinations), download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), 1.7 (or newer).</para>
        <para><phrase condition="pe">The Java-based modules of &abbrev; are tested and supported when using the Oracle implementation of Java. Other implementations are untested and unsupported, they may or may not work as expected.</phrase><phrase condition="ose">You can use OpenJDK or Oracle JDK, other implementations are not tested.</phrase></para>

    <step>
        <para>Download the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) libraries (version 2.x) from <link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html">http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html</link>.</para>
    </step>
    <step>
        <para>Extract the HDFS libraries into a temporary directory, then collect the various <filename>.jar</filename> files into a single directory (for example, <filename>/opt/hadoop/lib/</filename>) where &abbrev; can access them. You must specify this directory in the &abbrev; configuration file. The files are located in the various <filename>lib</filename> directories under the <filename>share/</filename> directory of the Hadoop release package. (For example, in Hadoop 2.7, required files are <filename>common/hadoop-common-2.7.0.jar</filename>, <filename>common/libs/*.jar</filename>, <filename>hdfs/hadoop-hdfs-2.7.0.jar</filename>, <filename>hdfs/lib/*</filename>, but this may change between Hadoop releases, so it is easier to copy every <filename>.jar</filename> file into a single directory.</para>

<!-- The java home must be given at installation time for the PE installer. FIXME: include it in the PE installer description!  -->
