<para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0" condition="pe">The <parameter>chain_hostnames()</parameter> option of syslog-ng can interfere with the way &abbrev; counts the log source hosts, causing syslog-ng to think there are more hosts logging to the central server, especially if the clients sends a hostname in the message that is different from its real hostname (as resolved from DNS). Disable the <parameter>chain_hostnames()</parameter> option on your log sources to avoid any problems related to license counting.</para>
