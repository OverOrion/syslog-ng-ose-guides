    <para><guilabel>Description:</guilabel> Indicates that the source should be checked periodically. This is useful for files which always indicate readability, even though no new lines were appended. If this value is higher than zero, syslog-ng will not attempt to use <parameter>poll()</parameter> on the file, but checks whether the file changed every time the <parameter>follow_freq()</parameter> interval (in seconds) has elapsed. Floating-point numbers (for example <parameter>1.5</parameter>) can be used as well.</para>
