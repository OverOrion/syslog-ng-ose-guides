    <para>Starting with version <phrase condition="pe">4 F1</phrase><phrase condition="ose">3.3</phrase>, &abbrev; can process sources and destinations in multithreaded mode to scale to multiple CPUs or cores for increased performance. Starting with version <phrase condition="ose">3.6</phrase><phrase condition="pe">5 F4</phrase>, this multithreaded mode is the default.</para>

        <title>Multithreading concepts of &abbrev;</title>
        <para>This section is a brief overview on how &abbrev; works in multithreaded mode. It is mainly for illustration purposes: the concept has been somewhat simplified and may not completely match reality.</para>
        <note>
            <para>The way &abbrev; uses multithreading may change in future releases. The current documentation applies to version &version;.</para>
        </note>
        <para>&abbrev; always uses multiple threads:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>A main thread that is always running</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>A number of worker threads that process the messages. You can influence the behavior of worker threads using the <parameter>threaded()</parameter> option and the <parameter>--worker-threads</parameter> command-line option.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Some other, special threads for internal functionalities. For example, certain destinations run in a separate thread, independently of the multithreading (<parameter>threaded()</parameter>) and <parameter>--worker-threads</parameter> settings of &abbrev;.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>The maximum number of worker threads &abbrev; uses is the number of CPUs or cores in the host running &abbrev; (up to 64). You can limit this value using the <parameter>--worker-threads</parameter> command-line option that sets the maximum total number of threads &abbrev; can use, including the main &abbrev; thread. However, the <parameter>--worker-threads</parameter> option does not affect the supervisor of &abbrev;. The supervisor is a separate process (see <xref linkend="syslog-ng.8"/>), but certain operating systems might display it as a thread. In addition, certain destinations always run in a separate thread, independently of the multithreading (<parameter>threaded()</parameter>) and <parameter>--worker-threads</parameter> settings of &abbrev;.</para>
        <para>When an event requiring a new thread occurs (for example, &abbrev; receives new messages, or a destination becomes available), &abbrev; tries to start a new thread. If there are no free threads, the task waits until a thread finishes its task and becomes available. There are two types of worker threads:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Reader threads read messages from a source (as many as possible, but limited by the <parameter>log-fetch-limit()</parameter> and <parameter>log-iw-size()</parameter> options. The thread then processes these messages, that is, performs filtering, rewriting and other tasks as necessary, and puts the log message into the queue of the destination. If the destination does not have a queue (for example, usertty), the reader thread sends the message to the destination, without the interaction of a separate writer thread.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Writer threads take the messages from the queue of the destination and send them to the destination, that is, write the messages into a file, or send them to the syslog server over the network. The writer thread starts to process messages from the queue only if the destination is writable, and there are enough messages in the queue, as set in the <parameter>flush-lines()</parameter> and the <parameter>flush-timeout()</parameter> options. Writer threads stop processing messages when the destination becomes unavailable, or there are no more messages in the queue.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <formalpara>
            <title>Sources and destinations affected by multithreading</title>
            <para>The following list describes which sources and destinations can use multiple threads. Changing the <parameter>--worker-threads</parameter> command-line option changes the number of threads available to these sources and destinations.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>The <parameter>tcp</parameter> and <userinput>syslog(tcp)</userinput> sources can process independent connections in separate threads. The number of independent connections is limited by the <parameter>max-connections()</parameter> option of the source. Separate sources are processed by separate thread, for example, if you have two separate <parameter>tcp</parameter> sources defined that receive messages on different IP addresses or port, &abbrev; will use separate threads for these sources even if they both have only a single active connection.</para>

        <para>Starting with version <phrase condition="ose">3.6</phrase><phrase condition="pe">5 F4</phrase>, &abbrev; runs in multithreaded mode by default. You can enable multithreading in &abbrev; using the following methods:</para>

        <para>Destinations that have a queue process that queue in a single thread. Multiple sources can send messages to the same queue, so the queue can scale to multiple CPUs. However, when the writer thread writes the queue contents to the destination, it will be single-threaded.</para>
        <para>Message parsing, rewrite rules, filters, and other types of message processing is performed by the reader thread in a sequential manner. This means that such operations can scale only if reading messages from the source can be multithreaded. For example, if a <parameter>tcp</parameter> source can process messages from different connections (clients) in separate threads. If the source cannot use multiple threads to process the messages, the operations will not scale.</para>
        <para>To improve the processing power of &abbrev; and scale to more processors, use the following methods:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>To improve scaling on the source side, use more sources, for example, more source files, or receive the messages from more parallel connections. For network sources, you can also configure a part of your clients to send the messages to a different port of your syslog-ng server, and use separate source definitions for each port.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>On the destination side, when writing the log messages to files, use macros in the filename to split the messages to separate files (for example, using the ${HOST} macro). Files with macros in their filenames are processed in separate writer threads.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>On the destination side, when sending messages to a syslog-ng server, you can use multiple connections to the server if you configure the syslog-ng server to receive messages on multiple ports, and configure the clients to use both ports.</para>
