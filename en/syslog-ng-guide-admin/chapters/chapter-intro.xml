    <title>Introduction to syslog-ng</title>
    <para>This chapter introduces the &product; application in a non-technical manner, discussing how and why is it useful, and the benefits it offers to an existing IT infrastructure.</para>
    <section>
        <title>What syslog-ng is</title>
        <para>The syslog-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging application that is ideal for creating centralized and trusted logging solutions. The main features of syslog-ng are summarized below.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Reliable log transfer</emphasis>: The syslog-ng application enables you to send the log messages of your hosts to remote servers using the latest protocol standards. The logs of different servers can be collected and stored centrally on dedicated log servers. Transferring log messages using the <phrase condition="pe"><trademark>RLTP</trademark></phrase><phrase condition="ose">TCP</phrase> protocol ensures that no messages are lost.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Secure logging using TLS</emphasis>: Log messages may contain sensitive information that should not be accessed by third parties. Therefore, syslog-ng supports the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to encrypt the communication. TLS also allows the mutual authentication of the host and the server using X.509 certificates.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Direct database access</emphasis>: Storing your log messages in a database allows you to easily search and query the messages and interoperate with log analyzing applications. The syslog-ng application supports the following databases: MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Heterogeneous environments</emphasis>: The syslog-ng application is the ideal choice to collect logs in massively heterogeneous environments using several different operating systems and hardware platforms, including Linux, Unix, BSD, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Tru64, and AIX.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Filter and classify</emphasis>: The syslog-ng application can sort the incoming log messages based on their content and various parameters like the source host, application, and priority. Directories, files, and database tables can be created dynamically using macros. Complex filtering using regular expressions and boolean operators offers almost unlimited flexibility to forward only the important log messages to the selected destinations.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Parse and rewrite</emphasis>: The syslog-ng application can segment log messages to named fields or columns, and also modify the values of these fields.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>IPv4 and IPv6 support</emphasis>: The syslog-ng application can operate in both IPv4 and IPv6 network environments; it can receive and send messages to both types of networks.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>What syslog-ng is not</title>
        <para>The syslog-ng application is not log analysis software. It can filter log messages and select only the ones matching certain criteria. It can even convert the messages and restructure them to a predefined format, or parse the messages and segment them into different fields. But syslog-ng cannot interpret and analyze the meaning behind the messages, or recognize patterns in the occurrence of different messages.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Why is syslog-ng needed?</title>
        <para>Log messages contain information about the events happening on the hosts. Monitoring system events is essential for security and system health monitoring reasons.</para>
        <para>The original syslog protocol separates messages based on the priority of the message and the facility sending the message. These two parameters alone are often inadequate to consistently classify messages, as many applications might use the same facility &mdash; and the facility itself is not even included in the log message. To make things worse, many log messages contain unimportant information. The syslog-ng application helps you to select only the really interesting messages, and forward them to a central server.</para>
        <para>Company policies or other regulations often require log messages to be archived. Storing the important messages in a central location greatly simplifies this process.</para>
        <para>For details on how can you use syslog-ng to comply with various regulations, see the <emphasis>Regulatory compliance and system logging</emphasis> whitepaper <link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="https://syslog-ng.com/documentation"
