    <title>Introduction to syslog-ng</title>
    <para>This chapter introduces the &product; application in a non-technical manner, discussing how and why is it useful, and the benefits it offers to an existing IT infrastructure.</para>
    <section>
        <title>What syslog-ng is</title>
        <para>The syslog-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging application that is ideal for creating centralized and trusted logging solutions. Among others, &abbrev; allows you the following.</para>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Secure and reliable log transfer</title>
            <para>The &abbrev; application enables you to send the log messages of your hosts to remote servers using the latest protocol standards. You can collect and store your log data centrally on dedicated log servers. Transfer log messages using the <phrase condition="pe"><trademark>RLTP</trademark></phrase><phrase condition="ose">TCP</phrase> protocol ensures that no messages are lost.</para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Disk-based message buffering</title>
                <para>To minimize the risk of losing important log messages, the &abbrev; application can store messages on the local hard disk if the central log server or the network connection becomes unavailable. The syslog-ng application automatically sends the stored messages to the server when the connection is reestablished, in the same order the messages were received. The disk buffer is persistent â€“ no messages are lost even if syslog-ng is restarted.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Secure logging using TLS</title>
                <para>Log messages may contain sensitive information that should not be accessed by third parties. Therefore, &abbrev; supports the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to encrypt the communication. TLS also allows you to authenticate your clients and the logserver using X.509 certificates.</para>
            </formalpara>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Flexible data extraction and processing</title>
            <para>Most log messages are inherently unstructured, which makes them difficult to process. To overcome this problem, &abbrev; comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.</para>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Filter and classify</title>
                <para>The &abbrev; application can sort the incoming log messages based on their content and various parameters like the source host, application, and priority. You can create directories, files, and database tables dynamically using macros. Complex filtering using regular expressions and boolean operators offers almost unlimited flexibility to forward only the important log messages to the selected destinations.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Parse and rewrite</title>
                <para>The &abbrev; application can segment log messages to named fields or columns, and also modify the values of these fields. You can process JSON messages, key-value pairs, and more.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <para>To get the most information out of your log data, &abbrev; allows you to correlate log messages and aggregate the extracted information into a single message. You can also use external information to enrich your log data.</para>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Big data clusters</title>
            <para>The log data that your organization has to process, store, and review increases daily, so many organizations use big data solutions for their logs. To accomodate this huge amount of data, &abbrev; natively supports storing log messages in HDFS files and Elasticsearch clusters.</para>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Message queue support</title>
            <para>Large organizations increasingly rely on queuing infrastructure to transfer their data. &abbrev; supports Apache Kafka, the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP).</para>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>SQL, NoSQL, and monitoring</title>
            <para>Storing your log messages in a database allows you to easily search and query the messages and interoperate with log analyzing applications. The syslog-ng application supports the following databases: MongoDB, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.</para>
            <para>&abbrev; also allows you to extract the information you need from your log data, and directly send it to your Graphite, Redis, or Riemann monitoring system.</para>
        </simplesect>
        <simplesect>
            <title>Wide protocol and platform support</title>
            <formalpara>
                <title>syslog protocol standards</title>
                <para>syslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <formalpara>
                <title>Heterogeneous environments</title>
                <para>The &abbrev; application is the ideal choice to collect logs in massively heterogeneous environments using several different operating systems and hardware platforms, including Linux, Unix, BSD, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Tru64, and AIX.</para>
            </formalpara>
            <formalpara>
                <title>IPv4 and IPv6 support</title><para>The syslog-ng application can operate in both IPv4 and IPv6 network environments; it can receive and send messages to both types of networks.</para>
            </formalpara>

    <section>
        <title>What syslog-ng is not</title>
        <para>The syslog-ng application is not log analysis software. It can filter log messages and select only the ones matching certain criteria. It can even convert the messages and restructure them to a predefined format, or parse the messages and segment them into different fields. But syslog-ng cannot interpret and analyze the meaning behind the messages, or recognize patterns in the occurrence of different messages.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Why is syslog-ng needed?</title>
        <para>Log messages contain information about the events happening on the hosts. Monitoring system events is essential for security and system health monitoring reasons.</para>
        <para>The original syslog protocol separates messages based on the priority of the message and the facility sending the message. These two parameters alone are often inadequate to consistently classify messages, as many applications might use the same facility &mdash; and the facility itself is not even included in the log message. To make things worse, many log messages contain unimportant information. The syslog-ng application helps you to select only the really interesting messages, and forward them to a central server.</para>
        <para>Company policies or other regulations often require log messages to be archived. Storing the important messages in a central location greatly simplifies this process.</para>

    <section xml:id="syslog-ng_whatsnew">
        <title>What is new in &product; &version;?</title>
        <para>Version &version; of &product; includes the following main features:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can correlate and aggregate information from log messages using a few simple filters that are similar to SQL GROUPBY statements. You do not even have to configure a pattern database. For details, see <xref linkend="chapter-enrich-data"/>. Also, when correlating messages containing numerical information, you can use numerical template functions that work on numerical values of a correlation context. For details, see <xref linkend="template-function-numerical"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can use an external database file to append custom name-value pairs to incoming logs, thus extending, enriching, and complementing the data found in the log message. For example, you can create a database (or export it from an existing tool) that contains a list of hostnames or IP addresses, and the department of your organization that the host belongs to, the role of the host (mailserver, webserver, and so on), or similar contextual information. <xref linkend="chapter-correlating-log-messages"/> has been added to the document.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The new <parameter>elastic2()</parameter> destination driver supports Elastic Shield, the HTTP REST API of Elasticsearch versions 1.x-5.x, as well as sending log messages to Elasticsearch version 2.x and newer in transport mode and node mode. For details, see <xref linkend="configuring-destinations-elasticsearch2"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can directly post log messages to web services using the HTTP protocol, without having to use Java. For details, see <xref linkend="configuring-destinations-http-nonjava"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Configuring &abbrev; to send log messages to the Loggly and Logmatic Logging-as-a-Serviceproviders became much easier. For details, see <xref linkend="configuring-destinations-loggly"/> and <xref linkend="configuring-destinations-logmatic"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can use disk-based buffering can be used for storing messages on the local hard disk if the central log server or the network connection to the server becomes unavailable. For details, see <xref linkend="concepts-diskbuffer"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The new version of the pattern database schema allows you to create a new correlation context from an existing context (for example, to better track the state of an event). Also, parsing multiline messages is much easier now using the NLSTRING parser that parses a string until the end of the line. For details, see <xref linkend="what-is-new-patterndb-v5"/>, <xref linkend="element-patterndb-create-context"/>, and <xref linkend="patterndb-parser-nlstring"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can parse custom-formatted timestamps using the <parameter>date-parser()</parameter>. For details, see <xref linkend="date-parser"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can process the data from access logs of the Apache HTTP Server, and automatically separate these log messages to name-value pairs. For details, see <xref linkend="apache-access-log-parser"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>To better handle rewriting date-related fields, the <parameter>set()</parameter> rewrite operator now supports several timezone-related options. For details, see <xref linkend="rewrite-set"/>. Also, you can now explicitly unset a field if needed. For details, see <xref linkend="rewrite-unset"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>If you are sending log messages to an HP ArcSight SIEM, you can use a template function that formats name-value pairs as ArcSight Common Event Format extensions. For details, see <xref linkend="template-function-format-cef-extension"/>.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
