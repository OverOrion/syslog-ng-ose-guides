    <para>The &abbrev; application is open source, so if you have the necessary programming skills, you can extend it if its features are not adequate for your particular environment or needs. You can write destinations and other extensions to &abbrev; in C (the main language of &abbrev;), or using its language bindings, for example, Java or Python. For details on extending &abbrev;, see the <link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/syslog-ng/getting-started/details">&abbrev; Developer Guide</link>.</para>
