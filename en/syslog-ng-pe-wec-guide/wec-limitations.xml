    <title>Limitations</title>
    <para>The &wec; for &abbrev; currently has the following limitations:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Only source-initiated push subscriptions are supported (Windows hosts connect to the &wecabbrev; server).</para>
            <para>An advantage of this, however, is that this requires less firewall rules.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Only HTTPS and SSL certificate based authentication are supported. Kerberos authentication is not supported at the moment.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>The compression of events is not supported.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>The <xref linkend="table-batchsizelimit"/> and <xref linkend="table-batchtimeoutlimit"/> options are not enforced on the Windows host side: Windows is handling these values only as a recommendation.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>On Windows 7 and Windows 2008 platforms, there is a known issue. After several reconnects (if &wecabbrev; is restarted quickly), the remote sender can stop forwarding the logs for a certain period of time. In this case, restarting the Windows RM service can help.</para>
            <para>This issue can also occur between two Windows machines. It has been reported to Microsoft and is awaiting resolution.</para>
