    <title>Performance</title>
    <para>Performance is dependent on the number of event log messages that the Windows hosts send to &wecabbrev; and the capabilities of the XML parser.</para>
    <para>Our performance measurements indicate that &abbrev;'s XML parser is capable of parsing 15,000-20,000 events/second. The exact capacity of the XML parser depends on the complexity of the Windows log messages, as well as the performance of the hardware that &abbrev; and &wecabbrev; are running on. When the limit of 15,000-20,000 events/seconds is reached, a workaround is recommended.</para>
    <para>As the value set in the <parameter><xref linkend="table-batchsizelimit"/></parameter> parameter is treated only as a recommendation by the Windows hosts, there is no direct way to control the amount of messages arriving from the event source computers.</para>
    <para>A possible workaround is to launch multiple &wecabbrev; servers and create multiple <parameter>windowsevent()</parameter> sources in &abbrev;. That way, you can distribute your Windows hosts across multiple &wecabbrev; and &abbrev; servers, decreasing the load on individual servers.</para>
    <para>To run multiple &wecabbrev; services per &abbrev; service, you need to create your own init script. This is because the init script that comes with &wecabbrev; enables you to run only a single &wecabbrev; service per &abbrev; service.</para>
