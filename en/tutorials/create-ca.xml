        <title>Steps:</title>
        <para/>
    </formalpara>
    <step>
        <para>Create an empty directory and navigate into that directory:</para>
        <para><command>mkdir CA</command></para>
        <para><command>cd CA</command></para>
    </step>
    <step>
        <para>Create a few directories and give starting values to some support files:</para>
        <para><command>mkdir certs crl newcerts private</command></para>
        <para><command>echo "01" > serial</command></para>
        <para><command>cp /dev/null index.txt</command></para>
    </step>
    <step>
        <para>Copy <filename>openssl.conf</filename> to the current directory. Depending on your distributions, the source directory might be different, so check the list of files in the OpenSSL package before copying:</para>
        <para><command>cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf openssl.cnf</command></para>
    </step>
    <step>
        <para>Edit <filename>openssl.conf</filename> in the current directory:</para>
        <para><command>vi openssl.cnf</command></para>
    </step>
    <step>
        <para>Search for the following part and replace <filename>./DemoCA</filename> with a single dot:</para>
        <synopsis>[ CA_default ]

dir             = ./demoCA              # Where everything is kept
certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept </synopsis>
        <para>Change it to:</para>
        <synopsis>[ CA_default ]

dir             = .                     # Where everything is kept
certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept </synopsis>
    </step>
    <step>
        <para>As a last step, generate the certificate for the CA:</para>
        <para><command>openssl req -new -x509 -keyout private/cakey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 365 -config openssl.cnf</command></para>
        <para>The following will be displayed. Answer the questions as in the example:</para>
