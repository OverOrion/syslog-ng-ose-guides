    <title>Creating self-signed certificates</title>
    <para>TLS-encryption uses certificates to authenticate the server, and in case of mutual authentication, the client as well. The following sections show you how to create the required certificates.</para>
    <para>To use mutual authentication in &abbrev;, certificates are required. There are several commercial certificate authorities (CAs) who can help you, but the process costs both money and time (waiting until the submitted certificate is signed). This guide demonstrates how to create your very own Certificate Authority (CA) for creating self-signed certificates. It does not cover all the details, for example, changing expiration dates, only the minimally required steps to be able to use mutual authentication in &abbrev;.</para>
    <para>There are handy tools, such as CA.pl, which can make certificate creation and signing easier, but they are not available on all platforms, even if it is part of the OpenSSL software suite. On the other hand, the OpenSSL command line tool is available on all Linux distributions and BSD variants, so this tool will be used in the guide.</para>
