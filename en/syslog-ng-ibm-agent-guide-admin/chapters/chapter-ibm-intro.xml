	<title>Introduction to &agenti;</title>
	<para>&agenti; provides extended support for sending security, operator, server, and user log information to a Syslogd or Syslog-ng server, or any Syslogd or Syslog-ng compatible server. &agenti; can help you bring your IBM System i into your Security Information Management strategy to meet regulatory compliance requirements and to properly monitor for potential security breaches.</para>
	
	<section>
		<title>The Syslog data standard</title>
		<para>UNIX and Linux systems have long supported the collection of system and application logs under the general name of “syslogs”. Many system logs in these environments are text files that are created by various applications and services. System logs collect important information about the health of the server, and about the security environment. They are important sources of information about potential or real security threats. The format of system logs can be very informal and include just informational text. However, there is a formal standard for system logs in RFC 3164. When logs are collected by the &agentabbrev; application they are automatically placed in the RFC 3164 syslog format.</para>

		<title>The Common Event Format standard</title>
		<para>Some Security Information Management (SIM) products use a special log format called the Common Event Format (CEF). &agenti; supports the CEF format for customers who want to send information directly to a log monitoring systems in CEF format.</para>

		<title>System i security audit journal QAUDJRN</title>
		<para>The system audit journal QAUDJRN can be configured to capture a large number of security and system management events. The &agentabbrev; solution can capture the entries in the QAUDJRN journal in real time, format them for the Syslog or CEF format, and send them to a syslogd or Syslog-ng server. The syslog server can be running on the System i or any remote server. The IBM System i Security Reference Manual provides information on how to change system values, user profiles, and objects to capture various system change and security events.</para>

	<section>
		<title>System i QHST history log</title>
		<para>The System i QHST message log collects important job, user, and security information. &agentabbrev; can be configured to capture QHST entries and convert them to the security audit journal (QAUDJRN) for a permanent record of system activity. When this option is enabled, &agentabbrev; works as a background subsystem job to collect the logs in order to avoid losing log messages to du automated system clean, user deletions, etc.</para>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<title>System i operator messages</title>
		<para>The system operator message queue QSYSOPR receives application and system messages. The &agentabbrev; software can capture the messages in the QSYSOPR message queue, format them to the syslog or CEF standard, and send them to a syslog server on the same System i or to a syslog server on a remote system.</para>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<title>User auditing</title>
		<para>&agentabbrev; provides an easy way to view user profile authorities and change user auditing. In addition to viewing a user's explicit authorities on the user profile, &agentabbrev; will inspect any group profile or supplemental group profile to determine any authorities that are inherited from these users. You can then view the authorities and change the audit setting for each user. &agentabbrev; recommends an audit level for each user and you can change the audit setting.</para>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<title>User-generated logs</title>
		<para>&agentabbrev; provides command and API interfaces to allow a user program to create Syslog or CEF event records. User applications can provide simple text values for messages and specify the priority and facility ID for the message. Any user application can be enabled for syslog or CEF application messages.</para>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<title>Filtering log entries</title>
		<para>&agentabbrev; gives you the ability to filter the system audit journal (QAUDJRN) entries that you want to send to a central log server. This can reduce the amount of network traffic and the type of events you transmit to the server. &agentabbrev; provides a complete list of log system security audit journal event types and the security administrator can edit the events to suppress transmission to the central log server.</para>

		<title>Apache, Websphere, OpenSSH, PHP, Perl, and MySQL server logs</title>
		<para>Many System i customers use open source solutions such as the Apache web server, OpenSSH, Perl, or MySQL on the System i. These open source applications support normal logging functions. When enabled these applications send logs to the IFS directory /var/log. You can automatically send these logs to a Syslogd or Syslog-ng server using the Balabit Syslog-ng Open Source Edition or Premium Edition product. See the separate documentation on the Syslog-ng product.</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>Syslog-ng server for System i</title>
		<para>Patrick Townsend &amp; Associates has partnered with Balabit IT Security to bring the Syslog-ng product to the System i platform. This application can be installed and run as a service directly on the System i platform. The application runs in the Portable Application Solutions Environment (PASE). When installed on the System i the Syslog-ng server can be configured to send any logs in the IFS file system.</para>

		<title>Syslog-ng – the new standard for syslog processing</title>
		<para>Syslog-ng is the next generation of server processing for system log management. Syslog-ng is available in an open source version and in a premium edition that provides additional security and management functions (see web site <link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="http://www.balabit.com/">http://www.balabit.com/</link>). Syslog-ng is shipped with most Linux distributions and is available for a wide variety of platforms. Syslog-ng can act in one of three roles:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>As a client to collect and forward log information</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>As a relay to receive and forward log information</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>As a consolidation server to receive logs and save to a database</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>By consolidating logs on a central server Syslog-ng enables intelligent evaluation of system information in one location. See the separate documentation on the Syslog-ng software solutions.</para>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<title>Security information management</title>
		<para>Security information management systems attempt to monitor the health and security of all of the significant server systems in an Enterprise. Typically this means consolidating syslog and other information from servers in one repository, and then performing real-time analysis, reporting, and alerts of potential problems. A number of vendors provide software and appliance solutions for log analysis. These solutions include ArcSight ESM, Symantec SIM, LogLogic, CrossTec, and many others. &agenti; provides the solution needed to bring the System i platform into a common information management strategy.</para>
