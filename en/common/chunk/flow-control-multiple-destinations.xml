    <para>Using flow-control on a source has an important side-effect if the messages of the source are sent to multiple destinations. If flow-control is in use and one of the destinations cannot accept the messages, the other destinations do not receive any messages either, because syslog-ng stops reading the source. For example, if messages from a source are sent to two separate destinations (for example, two different remote servers), and the network connection to the server becomes unavailable, neither destinations will receive any messages.</para>
    <note>
        <para>Creating separate log paths for the destinations that use the same flow-controlled source does not avoid the problem.</para>
