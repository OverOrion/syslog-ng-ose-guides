<para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0">When using wildcards, &abbrev; monitors every matching file (up to the limit set in the <parameter>max-files()</parameter> option), and can receive new log messages from any of the files. However, monitoring (polling) many files (that is, more than ten) has a significant overhead and may affect performance. On Linux this overhead is not so significant, because &abbrev; uses the inotify feature of the kernel. Set the <parameter>max-files()</parameter> option at least to the number of files you want to monitor. If the wildcard-file source matches more files than the value of the <parameter>max-files()</parameter> option, it is random which files will &abbrev; actually monitor. The default value of <parameter>max-files()</parameter> is 100.</para>
