        <para>If <parameter>flush_limit</parameter> is set to 1: &abbrev; sends the message reliably: it sends a message to Elasticsearch, then waits for a reply from Elasticsearch. In case of failure, &abbrev; repeats sending the message, as set in the <parameter>retries()</parameter> parameter. If sending the message fails for <parameter>retries()</parameter> times, &abbrev; drops the message.</para>
        <para>This method ensures reliable message transfer, but is slow.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>If <parameter>flush_limit</parameter> is higher than 1: &abbrev; sends messages in a batch, and receives the response asynchronously. In case of a problem, &abbrev; cannot resend the messages.</para>
        <para>This method is relatively fast (depending on the size of <parameter>flush_limit</parameter>), but the transfer is not reliable. In transport mode, several messages can be lost before &abbrev; recognizes the error. Node mode is more reliable in this sense, because the message loss rate is significantly lower.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
        <para>If <parameter>concurrent-requests</parameter> is higher than 1, &abbrev; can send multiple batches simultaneously, increasing performance (and also the number of messages that can be lost in case of an error). For details, see <xref linkend="elasticsearch-option-elasticsearch-concurrent-requests"/>.</para>
