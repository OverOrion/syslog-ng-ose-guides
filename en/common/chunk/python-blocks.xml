        <para>The Python block must be a top-level block in the &abbrev; configuration file. If you store the Python code in a separate Python file and only include it in the &abbrev; configuration file, make sure that the PYTHON_PATH environment variable includes the path to the Python file, and export the PYTHON_PATH environment variable. For example: <command>export PYTHONPATH=/opt/syslog-ng/etc</command></para>

    <listitem>
        <para>The Python object is initiated only once, when &abbrev; is started or reloaded. That means it keeps the state of internal variables while &abbrev; is running.</para>

        <para>Using Python code in &abbrev; can significantly decrease the performance of &abbrev;, especially if the Python code is slow.</para>

        <para>Using Python in &abbrev; is recommended only if you are familiar with both Python and &abbrev;. Product support applies only to &abbrev;: that is, until the entry point of the Python code and passing the specified arguments to the Python code. &vendor; is not responsible for the quality, resource requirements, or any bugs in the Python code, nor any &abbrev; crashes, message losses, or any other damage caused by the improper use of this feature, unless explicitly stated in a contract with &vendor;.</para>
