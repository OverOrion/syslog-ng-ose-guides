    <para>The <command>syslog-ng-ctl credentials status</command> command allows you to query the status of the private keys that &abbrev; uses in the <parameter>network()</parameter> and <parameter>syslog()</parameter> drivers. The command returns the list of private keys used, and their status. For example:</para>
    <synopsis>syslog-ng-ctl credentials status
Secret store status:
/home/user/ssl_test/client-1/client-encrypted.key SUCCESS</synopsis>
    <para>If the status of a key is PENDING, you must provide the passphrase for the key, otherwise &abbrev; cannot use it. The sources and destinations that use these keys will not work until you provide the passwords. Other parts of the &abbrev; configuration will be unaffected. You must provide the passphrase of the password-protected keys every time &abbrev; is restarted.</para>
    <para>The following log message also notifies you of PENDING passphrases:</para>
    <synopsis>Waiting for password; keyfile='&lt;private.key&gt;'</synopsis>
