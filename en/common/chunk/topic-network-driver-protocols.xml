        <para>UDP is a simple datagram oriented protocol, which provides "best effort service" to transfer messages between hosts. It may lose messages, and no attempt is made to retransmit lost messages. The <emphasis><link linkend="concepts-message-bsdsyslog">BSD-syslog</link></emphasis> protocol traditionally uses UDP.</para>
        <para>Use UDP only if you have no other choice.</para>

        <para>TCP provides connection-oriented service: the client and the server establish a connection, each message is acknowledged, and lost packets are resent. TCP can detect lost connections, and messages are lost, only if the TCP connection breaks. When a TCP connection is broken, messages that the client has sent but were not yet received on the server are lost.</para>
