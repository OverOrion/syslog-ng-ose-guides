    <para>For untrusted certificates only the existence of the certificate is checked, but it does not have to be valid &mdash; syslog-ng accepts the certificate even if it is expired, signed by an unknown CA, or its CN and the name of the machine mismatches.</para>
    <warning>
        <para>When validating a certificate, the entire certificate chain must be valid, including the CA certificate. If any certificate of the chain is invalid, &abbrev; will reject the connection.</para>
