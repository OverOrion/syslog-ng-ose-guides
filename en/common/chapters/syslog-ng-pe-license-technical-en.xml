        <title>Limit on the maximum number of Log Source Host (LSH)</title>
        <para>The first licensing option for &product; is based on the number of Log Source Hosts.</para>
        <para>A Log Source Host (LSH) is defined as any host or server computers including virtual machines, active or passive networking devices from which a &vendor; &product; in server, relay, or client mode receives log messages. Log source hosts are identified by their IP addresses, so virtual machines
            and vhosts are separately counted.</para>
        <para>The &product; application has three distinct modes of operation: Client, Server, and Relay.</para>
        <para>Client mode is defined as the mode of operation in which &product; collects local logs generated by the host and forwards them through a network connection to the central &abbrev; server, a relay, or other network destination.</para>
        <para>Relay mode is defined as the mode of operation in which &product; receives and forwards logs through the network from Log Source Hosts which are defined as host or server computers including virtual machines, active or passive networking devices.</para>
        <para>Server mode is defined as the mode of operation in which &product; acts as a central log-collecting server receiving messages through a network connection.</para>

            <para>There are two facilities (for example data centers or server farms). Facility 1 has 75 AIX servers and 20 Microsoft Windows hosts, Facility 2 has 5 HP-UX servers and 40 Debian servers. That is 140 hosts altogether.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>Each facility has its own logserver, and there is no central logserver., you
                        need two separate licenses: a license for 96 hosts at Facility 1, and a
                        license for at least 46 hosts at Facility 2.</para>
                    <para>The &product; license for 100 LSH is required at Facility 1 and a license for 50 LSH is required at Facility 2.</para>

                    <para>Each facility to has its own local logserver, and there is also a central logserver that collects every
                        log message independently from the two local logservers.</para>
                    <para>Three licenses are required. The &product; license for 100 LSH is required at Facility 1, a license for 50 LSH is required at Facility 2, and also a license for 150 LSH for the central logserver.</para>
                    <note>
                        <para>If, for example, the 40 Debian servers at Facility 2 are each running
                            3 virtual hosts, then the total number of hosts at Facility 2 is 125,
                            and the license sizes should be calculated accordingly.</para>

        <title>Limit on the maximum number of used processors (CPU cores)</title>
        <para>The latest version of &product; supports multi-thread processing. The technical limitation of the maximum number of processors (CPU cores) is based on the number of worker-threads started by &product; when processing log messages. syslog-ng has a main thread that is always running, and a number of worker threads that process messages.  Certain processes run on threads, designated as writer-threads, that are independent of both main and worker-threads. Under CPU core based licensing, the maximum number of worker-threads is set in the license file. As writer-threads are initiated independently, the license limitation is not valid for them.</para>
        <note><para>The &product; does not set any limitation on how the log server Operating System uses processors or how CPU-time is distributed between all running worker-threads. Hence, the availability of CPUs or cores in a given machine, physical or virtual, is transparent to &product;. If multi-threading is enabled, &product; will initiate worker-threads until the worker-thread limit is reached.</para></note>
