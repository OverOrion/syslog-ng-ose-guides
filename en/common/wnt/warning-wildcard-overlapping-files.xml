<para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0">If you use multiple <parameter>wildcard-file()</parameter> sources in your configuration, make sure that the files and folders that match the wildcards do not overlap. That is, every file and folder should belong to only one file source. Monitoring a file from multiple wildcard sources can lead to data loss.</para>
