    <para>It is common practice for log rotate solutions to reload &abbrev; (by sending a HUP signal or using the operating system's init subsystem) and for users to execute <command>syslog-ng-ctl reload</command> (to start a configuration file reload). Care should be taken in these cases, because the methods and attributes defined in a Python parser block definition lose their context and state during a &abbrev; reload.</para>
