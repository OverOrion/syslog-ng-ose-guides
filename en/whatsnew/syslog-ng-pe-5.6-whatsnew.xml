        <title>Preface</title>
        <para>Welcome to &product; (&abbrev;) version &version; and thank you for choosing our product. This document describes the new features and most important changes since the latest release of &abbrev;. The main aim of this paper is to aid system administrators in planning the migration to the new version of &abbrev;. The following sections describe the news and highlights of &abbrev; &version;.</para>
        <para>This document covers the &version; feature release of the &product; product.</para>
        <para>The following release policy applies to &product;:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Long Term Supported or LTS releases</emphasis> (for example, &abbrev; 4 LTS) are supported for 3 years after their original publication date and for 1 year after the next LTS release is published (whichever date is later). The second digit of the revisions of such releases is 0 (for example, &abbrev; 4.0.1). Maintenance releases to LTS releases contain only bugfixes and security updates.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Feature releases</emphasis> (for example, &abbrev; 4 F1) are supported for 6 months after their original publication date and for 2 months after succeeding Feature or LTS Release is published (whichever date is later). Feature releases contain enhancements and new features, presumably 1-3 new feature per release. Only the last of the feature releases is supported (for example when a new feature release comes out, the last one becomes unsupported).</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <warning>
            <para>Downgrading from a feature release to an earlier (and thus unsupported) feature release, or to the previous LTS release is officially not supported, but usually works as long as your &abbrev; configuration file is appropriate for the old &abbrev; version. However, persistent data like the position of the last processed message in a file source will be probably lost.</para>
            <para>Logstore files created with a newer version of &abbrev; might not be readable with an older version of &abbrev;.</para>
        </warning>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Elasticsearch 2.x and Shield support</title>
        <para>Version 5 F6 of &abbrev; supports Elasticsearch version 2.0 and newer. Because of compatibility reasons, &abbrev; has a separate destination (<parameter>elasticsearch2()</parameter>) that you can use with Elasticsearch version 2.0 and newer.</para>
        <para><link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="https://www.elastic.co/products/shield">Elasticsearch Shield</link> is supported for both Elasticsearch 1.x and 2.x destinations, allowing you to authenticate your &abbrev; clients on the Elasticsearch server.</para>
        <para>For details, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="configuring-destinations-elasticsearch2"/>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Unsupported platforms</title>
        <para>Starting with &pe; version &version;, the following platforms are not officially supported:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Debian 6 (squeeze)</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>For a complete list of supported platforms, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="supported-platforms"/>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Other changes</title>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can now specify the location where &abbrev; stores the disk-buffer files using the <parameter>dir()</parameter> option of <parameter>disk-buffer()</parameter>. Note that the <parameter>dir()</parameter> option overrides the settings of the <parameter>--qdisk-dir</parameter> command-line option.</para>
