        <title>Preface</title>
        <para>Welcome to &product; (&abbrev;) version &version; and thank you for choosing our product. This document describes the new features and most important changes since the latest release of &abbrev;. The main aim of this paper is to aid system administrators in planning the migration to the new version of &abbrev;. The following sections describe the news and highlights of &abbrev; &version;.</para>
        <para>This document covers the &version; feature release of the &product; product.</para>
        <para>As of June 2011, the following release policy applies to &product;:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Long Term Supported or LTS releases</emphasis> (for example, &abbrev; 4 LTS) are supported for 3 years after their original publication date and for 1 year after the next LTS release is published (whichever date is later). The second digit of the revisions of such releases is 0 (for example, &abbrev; 4.0.1). Maintenance releases to LTS releases contain only bugfixes and security updates.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis>Feature releases</emphasis> (for example, &abbrev; 4 F1) are supported for 6 months after their original publication date and for 2 months after succeeding Feature or LTS Release is published (whichever date is later). Feature releases contain enhancements and new features, presumably 1-3 new feature per release. Only the last of the feature releases is supported (for example when a new feature release comes out, the last one becomes unsupported).</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <warning>
            <para>Downgrading from a feature release to an earlier (and thus unsupported) feature release, or to the previous LTS release is officially not supported, but usually works as long as your &abbrev; configuration file is appropriate for the old &abbrev; version. However, persistent data like the position of the last processed message in a file source will be probably lost.</para>
            <para>Logstore files created with a newer version of &abbrev; might not be readable with an older version of &abbrev;.</para>
        </warning>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) support</title>
        <para>Version <phrase condition="pe">5.3</phrase><phrase condition="ose">3.7</phrase> of &abbrev; can send plain-text log files to the <link xmlns:ns1="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ns1:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</link>, allowing you to store your log data on a distributed, scalable file system. This is especially useful if you have huge amount of log messages that would be difficult to store otherwise, or if you want to process your messages using Hadoop tools (for example, Apache Pig). For details, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="configuring-destinations-hdfs"/>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Displaying license-related information</title>
        <para>The &abbrev; application uses a license in server mode to determine the maximum number of hosts that are allowed to connect. Use the <command>syslog-ng-ctl show-license-info</command> command to display license-related information the number of hosts currently logging to your server. This helps you to plan your capacity, to check your license usage, and to detect client misconfiguration that can result in a license miscount anomaly. Note that in client or relay mode, &abbrev; does not require a license. For details, see <olink targetdoc="syslog-ng-pe-guide-admin" targetptr="syslog-ng-ctl-show-license-info"/>.</para>
