    <title>Highlights of 7.0.6</title>
    <simplesect>
        <title>&wec; for &abbrev;</title>
        <para>The &wec; (&wecabbrev;) acts as a log collector and forwarder tool for the Microsoft Windows platform. It collects the log messages of Windows-based hosts over HTTPS (using TLS encryption and mutual authentication), and forwards them to a &abbrev; server. In Windows terminology, this tool allows you to define source-initiated subscriptions, and have them forwarded to a &abbrev; server.</para>
        <para>Unlike the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://syslog-ng.com/documents/html/syslog-ng-pe-6.0-guides/en/syslog-ng-windows-agent-guide-admin/html/index.html">&agent;</link>, the &wec; is a standalone tool that does not require installing on the Windows-based host itself. This can be an advantage when your organization's policies restrict or do not allow the installation of third-party tools. The &wec; sits between your Windows hosts and your &product; server, accepting log messages from the remote Windows side with WinRM and feeding them to &product; 7.0.</para>

        <title>Support for unsetting a group of fields</title>
        <para>In addition to unsetting a macro or a field of a message, you can now explicitly unset a group of fields too, using the <parameter>groupunset()</parameter> rewrite rule.</para>
