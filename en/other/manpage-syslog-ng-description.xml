    <para>The &abbrev; application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging application. Typically, syslog-ng is used to manage log messages and implement centralized logging, where the aim is to collect the log messages of several devices on a single, central log server. The different devices - called syslog-ng clients - all run syslog-ng, and collect the log messages from the various applications, files, and other <emphasis>sources</emphasis>. The clients send all important log messages to the remote syslog-ng server, where the server sorts and stores them.</para>
