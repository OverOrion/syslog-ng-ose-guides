        <para><emphasis>Long Term Supported or LTS releases</emphasis> (for example, &agentabbrev; 4 LTS) are supported for 3 years after their original publication date and for 1 year after the next LTS release is published (whichever date is later). The second digit of the revisions of such releases is 0 (for example, &abbrev; 4.0.1). Maintenance releases to LTS releases contain only bugfixes and security updates.</para>

    <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Feature releases</emphasis> (for example, &agentabbrev; 4 F1) are supported for 6 months after their original publication date and for 2 months after succeeding Feature or LTS Release is published (whichever date is later). Feature releases contain enhancements and new features, presumably 1-3 new feature per release. Only the last of the feature releases is supported (for example when a new feature release comes out, the last one becomes unsupported).</para>
        <para condition="pe">For a full description on stable and feature releases, see the &version-policy;.</para>
        <warning>
            <para>Downgrading from a feature release to an earlier (and thus unsupported) feature release, or to the previous LTS release is officially not supported, but usually works as long as your &abbrev; configuration file is appropriate for the old &abbrev; version. However, persistent data like the position of the last processed message in a file source will be probably lost.</para>
            <para>Logstore files created with a newer version of &abbrev; might not be readable with an older version of &abbrev;.</para>
