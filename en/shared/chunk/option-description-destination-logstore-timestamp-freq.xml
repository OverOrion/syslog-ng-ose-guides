    <para><emphasis role="bold">Description:</emphasis> The minimum time (in seconds) that should expire between two timestamping requests. When syslog-ng closes a chunk, it checks how much time has expired since the last timestamping request: if it is higher than the value set in the <parameter>timestamp-freq()</parameter> parameter, it requests a new timestamp from the authority set in the <parameter>timestamp-url()</parameter> parameter.</para>
    <para>By default, timestamping is disabled: the <parameter>timestamp-freq()</parameter> global option is set to 0. To enable timestamping, set it to a positive value.</para>
