    <para>After the installation is finished, add the <filename>/opt/syslog-ng/bin</filename> and <filename>/opt/syslog-ng/sbin</filename> directories to your search PATH environment variable. That way you can use &abbrev; and its related tools without having to specify the full pathname. Add the following line to your shell profile:</para>
    <synopsis>PATH=/opt/syslog-ng/bin:$PATH </synopsis>
