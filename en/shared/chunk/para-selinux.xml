<para xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" version="5.0">Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a set of kernel and user-space tools enforcing strict access control policies. SELinux rules in Linux distributions cover all aspects of the syslog-ng configuration coming in the syslog-ng package available in the distribution. But as soon as an unusual port number or directory name is specified in the configuration, syslog-ng fails to work even with a completely legitimate configuration.</para>
