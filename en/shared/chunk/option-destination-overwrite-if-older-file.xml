    <para><emphasis role="bold">Description:</emphasis> If set to a value higher than 0, &abbrev; checks when the file was last modified before starting to write into the file. If the file is older than the specified amount of time (in seconds), then syslog-ng removes the existing file and opens a new file with the same name. In combination with for example the <parameter>${WEEKDAY}</parameter> macro, this can be used for simple log rotation, in case not all history has to be kept. (Note that in this weekly log rotation example if its Monday 00:01, then the file from last Monday is not seven days old, because it was probably last modified shortly before 23:59 last Monday, so it is actually not even six days old. So in this case, set the <parameter>overwrite-if-older()</parameter> parameter to a-bit-less-than-six-days, for example, to <userinput>518000</userinput> seconds.</para>
