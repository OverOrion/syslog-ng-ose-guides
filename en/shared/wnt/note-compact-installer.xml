    <para>There are two versions of every binary release. The one with the <filename>compact</filename> suffix does not include SQL support. If you are installing &abbrev; in client or relay mode, or you do not use the <parameter>sql()</parameter> source or destination, use the <filename>compact</filename> binaries. That way no unnecessary components are installed to your system.</para>
