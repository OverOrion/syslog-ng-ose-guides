    <para>When creating a new <parameter>dir()</parameter> option for a disk buffer, or modifying an existing one, make sure you delete the persist file.</para>
    <para>&abbrev; creates disk-buffer files based on the path recorded in the persist file. Therefore, if the persist file is not deleted after modifying the <parameter>dir()</parameter> option, then following a restart, &abbrev; will look for or create disk-buffer files in their old location. To ensure that &abbrev; uses the new <parameter>dir()</parameter> setting, the persist file must not contain any information about the destinations which the disk-buffer file in question belongs to.</para>
